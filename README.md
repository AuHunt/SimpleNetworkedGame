# SimpleNetworkedGame
I decided to learn some low-level networking and the tools provided in GameMaker Studio 2 to make a simple multiplayer game where a server is created on the host computer and anyone with the game can join. For now, this is hard-coded to work on my IP only since it was only a proof of concept but I'm planning to implement a menu that would allow anyone to host a server.
